# BI_analyst_exercise

This is an exercise I completed as part of a recruitment process for a major Finnish delivery company. My solution passed the bar and was praised for error tolerance and accuracy. This exercise required me to combine my skills in Python, SQL and Excel to format, move, sort and visualize the data.
